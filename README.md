This is a practice project for SCSS, it's a very small project with just header and hero section but it covers most of the major topics of SCSS language. From variable declarations, functions, mixins to media queries it contains everything you need to learn SCSS.

More over I highly prefer SCSS course on LearnCodeOnline website and 1-2 crash courses on youtube. Otherthan this you only need practice to be more proficient in working with SCSS.

Below is the final desktop view of this small project.
